# Heuristic Optimization Algorithms

When a numerical solution cannot be found for a problem, heuristics are used. Thanks to these algorithms, it is possible to obtain results very close to the best, although not in a deterministic way.

This repository contains implementations of various heuristic optimization algorithms for solving different problems.

## Algorithms Included

1. **Ant Colony Optimization (ACO):**
   - Directory: `ant_colony`
   - Description: ACO is a nature-inspired optimization algorithm based on the foraging behavior of ants. It is used for solving combinatorial optimization problems and finding near-optimal solutions.

2. **Bisection Algorithm:**
   - Directory: `bisection`
   - Description: The bisection algorithm is a root-finding method that repeatedly bisects an interval and then selects a subinterval where a root must lie for further processing. It's useful for finding roots of continuous functions.

3. **Genetic Algorithm (GA):**
   - Directory: `genetic_algorithm`
   - Description: The Genetic Algorithm is inspired by the process of natural selection. It evolves a population of potential solutions to find the best solution to a problem. It is widely used in optimization and search problems.

4. **Golden Section Algorithm:**
   - Directory: `golden_section`
   - Description: The golden section search algorithm is an optimization technique for finding the minimum of a unimodal function. It iteratively narrows down the search interval based on the golden ratio.

5. **Gradient Descent Algorithm:**
   - Directory: `gradient_descent`
   - Description: Gradient Descent is an iterative optimization algorithm used for finding the minimum of a function. It moves towards the steepest local descent direction.

6. **Newton-Raphson Algorithm:**
   - Directory: `newton_raphson`
   - Description: The Newton-Raphson algorithm is an iterative method for finding the roots of a differentiable function. It converges quickly when the initial guess is close to the actual root.
